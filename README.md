## Sinatra API

**Introduction**

>This Repo has been made to to learn how to combine json API gathering with ruby gems for file structure. The gem used was Sinatra to help create the routes necessary for the web based app. The structure is typical of that for readability and neatness. The API used was an offline database stored in psql.

**Setup**

>The setup for creating the link to psql is in the SinatraJSONAPI folder README

**Walkthrough**

>To use the web app, clone the entire repo on to your local machine and cd into it.
Run 'rackup' in the terminal and go in to your preferred browser. On the result of rackup is a snipped of info that looks like 'localhost:9292'. Copy that into the browser address. The link should work and all the roots should work.

>To make any changes on the controller, follow the existing structure  keeping to the style and formatting of the code and file structure.
